Description: VisualSHIELD is an open-source R package and shiny module that builds on the study database Opal and the DataSHIELD library to perform federated statistical analyses. It provides a ready-to-use web app module that can be integrated in any custom shiny app, providing a high-level interface to access all the DataSHIELD functionalities, and more, from the web. This package contains a shiny module, that means that it can be used as a building block of any custom shiny app and allows to configure and invoke DataSHIELD and Opal, and to render as HTML the output of the analyses without writing R code. The module is exposed through the VisualSHIELDUI and the VisualSHIELDServer functions. See 'example' for an example usage. It allows also to port dbNP data to Opal, in such a way that also dbNP data can be used in the analysis.
